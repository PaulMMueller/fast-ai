# fast-ai
Paul wants a git repo as he doesn't like to talk.

## Plan
We want to learn how to train and use a neuro-net within the *fast.ai* framework. We use this tutorial by Jeremy Howard:   `https://course.fast.ai`  
The lectures can be found at: `https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=1`  
  
Additionally we want to improve our amazing *git* skills, learn how to use cloud computing and GPUs.
